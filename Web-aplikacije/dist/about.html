                Dragon Ball (Japanese: ドラゴンボール, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru) is a Japanese media franchise created by Akira Toriyama in 1984. 
                The initial manga, written and illustrated by Toriyama, was serialized in Weekly Shōnen Jump from 1984 to 1995, with the 519 
                individual chapters collected into 42 tankōbon volumes by its publisher Shueisha. Dragon Ball was originally inspired by the 
                classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West, combined with elements of Hong Kong martial arts films. The series 
                follows the adventures of protagonist Son Goku from his childhood through adulthood as he trains in martial arts. He spends 
                his childhood far from civilization until he meets a teen girl named Bulma, who encourages him to join her quest in exploring 
                the world in search of the seven orbs known as the Dragon Balls, which summon a wish-granting dragon when gathered. Along his 
                journey, Goku makes several other friends, becomes a family man, discovers his alien heritage, and battles a wide variety of 
                villains, many of whom also seek the Dragon Balls.

                Toriyama's manga was adapted and divided into two anime series produced by Toei Animation: Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball Z, which 
                together were broadcast in Japan from 1986 to 1996. Additionally, the studio has developed 20 animated feature films and three 
                television specials, as well as two anime sequel series titled Dragon Ball GT (1996-1997) and Dragon Ball Super (2015-2018).
                 From 2009 to 2015, a revised version of Dragon Ball Z aired in Japan under the title Dragon Ball Kai, as a recut that follows 
                 the manga's story more faithfully by removing most of the material featured exclusively in the anime. Several companies have 
                 developed various types of merchandising based on the series leading to a large media franchise that includes films, both 
                 animated and live-action, collectible trading card games, numerous action figures, along with several collections of soundtracks 
                 and numerous video games. Dragon Ball has become one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.

                Since its release, Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga and anime series of all time, with the manga sold in over 
                40 countries and the anime broadcast in more than 80 countries. The manga's 42 collected tankōbon volumes have sold over 160 million 
                copies in Japan, and are estimated to have sold more than 250-300 million copies worldwide, making it two best-selling manga series 
                in history. Reviewers have praised the art, characterization, and humour of the story. It is widely regarded as one of the greatest 
                and most influential manga series ever made, with many manga artists citing Dragon Ball as a source of inspiration for their own 
                now-popular works. The anime, particularly Dragon Ball Z, is also highly popular around the world and is considered one of the most 
                influential in boosting the popularity of Japanese animation in Western culture. It has had a considerable impact on global popular 
                culture, referenced by and inspiring numerous artists, athletes, celebrities, filmmakers, musicians and writers around the world.
