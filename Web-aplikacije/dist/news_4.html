				<h1>Is Zeno really the strongest?</h1>
				<h2>The greatest supreme being in the Dragon Ball mythos is Grand Zeno... but is the unassuming Omni King really the most powerful?</h2>
				<p>
					Ever since Dragon Ball, Goku and the Z Fighters have met omnipotent beings wielding the power of the gods, with escalating strength. 
					Dragon Ball Super opened with Goku and Vegeta fighting Beerus, their universe's God of Destruction, who -- along with his constant 
					companion Whis -- was the strongest deity they had encountered at that time. Halfway through Dragon Ball Super, however, the characters 
					encountered Grand Zeno, a supreme being that oversees the entire Dragon Ball Multiverse.
				</p>
				<p>
					Here is a quick overview of Zeno and whether he truly is the most powerful being introduced in the entire Dragon Ball mythos.
				</p>
				<img src="img/ZENO.jpg" alt="Vegito vs Gogeta" title="Vegito vs Gogeta">
				<p>
					Grand Zeno is introduced at the end of the Tournament of Destruction, pitting the best martial artists of Universes 6 and 7 against each 
					other in a friendly competition. Appearing following Universe 7's victory, Zeno is initially annoyed that he hadn't been invited to the 
					proceedings by the Gods of Destruction serving under him but this was tempered by his enjoyment of watching the fighting contest from afar. 
					The Gods of Destruction are seen to be in clear fear of Zeno's vast destructive potential and cower in respect.
				</p>
				<p>
					According to Whis, Zeno reigns over the Dragon Ball Multiverse as its Omni King and had erased six entire universes when he found himself in 
					"an unpleasant mood." Prior this unseen event, there had been eighteen universes within the Multiverse, now, only twelve remain. Quickly befriending 
					Goku, Zeno makes him promise to meet him in his home outside of the twelve realities to have fun on a playdate, befitting his childlike appearance.
				</p>
				<p>
					The level of awareness and power demonstrated by the Zeno is completely unseen. Kami, the first godly figure seen in Dragon Ball couldn't even defeat 
					Piccolo at the end of the original series while King Kai, the god seen at the start of Dragon Ball Z, was ultimately killed by Cell. Even the Supreme 
					Kai acknowledged that Goku was stronger than him in his Super Saiyan form, conceding to the protagonist when they reached a disagreement. While Beerus 
					has displayed strength outclassing Goku, nothing has the sheer power of the Grand Zeno from either timeline, has been seen. Zeno can completely obliterate 
					an entire reality without any visible degree of visible exertion and appears to be aware of much around him. Commanding the deepest respect from Beerus, 
					Zeno is the most powerful being in the Dragon Ball mythos to date.
